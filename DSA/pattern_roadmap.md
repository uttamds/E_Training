here’s a **DSA Pattern Roadmap** that you can share with your students to use LeetCode/HackerRank **in a structured way** instead of getting lost in 1000s of problems.

---

# 🛣️ DSA Pattern Roadmap for Students

*(Practice on LeetCode/HackerRank in 6–8 weeks)*

---

## **Week 1 – Arrays & Hashing (Basics)**

🎯 Goal: Get comfortable with array traversal & using hashmaps/sets.

* Two Sum (LeetCode #1)
* Contains Duplicate
* Valid Anagram
* Group Anagrams

👉 Pattern learned: **Hashing + lookup**

---

## **Week 2 – Two Pointers & Sliding Window**

🎯 Goal: Handle problems involving subarrays & string windows.

* Valid Palindrome
* Two Sum II (sorted input)
* 3Sum
* Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
* Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

👉 Pattern learned: **Move left/right pointers to shrink/grow window**

---

## **Week 3 – Stack & Queue**

🎯 Goal: Understand how to handle order-dependent problems.

* Valid Parentheses
* Min Stack
* Daily Temperatures
* Implement Queue using Stacks

👉 Pattern learned: **Use stack to manage constraints**

---

## **Week 4 – Recursion & Backtracking**

🎯 Goal: Learn backtracking structure.

* Subsets
* Permutations
* Combination Sum
* N-Queens (our demo!)

👉 Pattern learned: **DFS + backtrack when invalid**

---

## **Week 5 – Trees & Graphs**

🎯 Goal: Traverse trees/graphs with DFS & BFS.

* Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
* Invert Binary Tree
* Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
* Number of Islands
* Clone Graph

👉 Pattern learned: **DFS, BFS, Recursion**

---

## **Week 6 – Dynamic Programming (DP Basics)**

🎯 Goal: Handle overlapping subproblems.

* Fibonacci (recursive → memoization → tabulation)
* Climbing Stairs
* House Robber
* Coin Change (intro to DP)

👉 Pattern learned: **Memoization + Tabulation**

---

## **Week 7 – Greedy & Advanced DP**

🎯 Goal: Understand optimal substructure & advanced states.

* Jump Game
* Gas Station
* Longest Increasing Subsequence
* Edit Distance

👉 Pattern learned: **Choose optimal local moves / complex DP**

---

## **Week 8 – Mixed & Mock Practice**

🎯 Goal: Mix patterns to simulate interviews.

* Randomly pick 2–3 problems daily from earlier weeks.
* Try **medium-level problems** from mixed tags.
* Simulate **timed practice (30–45 mins per problem)**.

---

# 📌 Notes for Students

* Solve **\~1–2 problems daily**.
* Focus on **understanding patterns**, not memorizing solutions.
* After solving → **revisit without looking at solution**.
* Maintain a **notebook of patterns/templates**.

---

✅ If followed, after \~8 weeks:

* A student won’t know all 2000 LeetCode problems 😅,
* But they will recognize **core patterns (20–30)** that cover **80% of interview questions**.
