Ah yes — that’s an important clarification. Let me explain carefully so there’s **no confusion between `hello` and `amazon` URLs**.

---

## **Django URL Structure**

1. **Project-level `urls.py`** (`mysite/urls.py`)

   * This is the main URL configuration for your whole project.
   * It usually **includes app-level URLs** via `include()`.

2. **App-level `urls.py`** (`hello/urls.py` or `amazon/urls.py`)

   * Each app can have its **own URL patterns**.
   * Makes the project modular and clean.

---

## **Option 1: All URLs in Project `urls.py` (Simple Demo)**

For small demos, it’s fine to define **both apps’ URLs directly** in `mysite/urls.py`.
Example:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from hello import views as hello_views
from amazon import views as amazon_views

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),

    # hello app (existing)
    path('student/', hello_views.student_list, name='student_list'),

    # amazon app (new)
    path('register/', amazon_views.register, name='register'),
    path('login/', amazon_views.user_login, name='login'),
    path('logout/', amazon_views.user_logout, name='logout'),
    path('dashboard/', amazon_views.dashboard, name='dashboard'),
]
```

✅ Advantage: Very simple, everything in one file.
❌ Disadvantage: Project `urls.py` can get messy if you have many apps.

---

## **Option 2: Use App-level `urls.py` (Recommended for bigger projects)**

### **Step 1: Create `amazon/urls.py`**

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('register/', views.register, name='register'),
    path('login/', views.user_login, name='login'),
    path('logout/', views.user_logout, name='logout'),
    path('dashboard/', views.dashboard, name='dashboard'),
]
```

### **Step 2: Include App URLs in Project `urls.py`**

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('amazon/', include('amazon.urls')),  # all amazon URLs prefixed with /amazon/
    path('hello/', include('hello.urls')),    # your existing hello app URLs
]
```

✅ Now, the URLs become:

* Registration → `/amazon/register/`
* Login → `/amazon/login/`
* Dashboard → `/amazon/dashboard/`

This keeps each app **self-contained**.

---

### **Tip**

* For your **existing `hello` app**, if it already has `urls.py` with patterns like `student_list`, keep them there and include them in project `urls.py` as shown above.
* For the new `amazon` app, it’s best to create `amazon/urls.py` and include it in project `urls.py`.

---

So the **confusion is solved** by:

1. Using **app-level `urls.py`** for each app.
2. Including them in the **project `urls.py`** with a prefix if desired.

---

If you want, I can **rewrite the complete “amazon auth app” URLs and project URLs** exactly using the **app-level `urls.py` method**, so it’s clean and ready to use.

Do you want me to do that?
